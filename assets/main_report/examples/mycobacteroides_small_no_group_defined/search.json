These similarity metrics are based on the presence and abundance of short exact sequence matches between samples (i.e. comparisons of k-mer sketches). These measurements are not as reliable as the methods used to create phylogenetic trees, but may be useful if phylogenetic trees could not be inferred for these samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this table\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table shows the Percentage Of Conserved Proteins (POCP) between each sample and the 2 references most similar to it based on this measure. POCP is used to measure the proportion of proteins shared between two genomes. Which proteins are shared is determined from pairwise comparisons of all proteins between all genomes. The POCP between two genomes is the sum of the number of shared proteins in each genome divided by the sum of the number of total proteins in each genome (Qin et al. 2014). Currently, POCP is only calculated for Prokaryotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the results of comparing the protein content of all samples and references to each other.
